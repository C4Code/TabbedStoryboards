/** C4Object is the root class of any object in the C4 framework that does not have a visual representation. For example, a C4Font cannot be represented visually so it is a C4Object, whereas a C4Label is something to be seen on screen so it is instead a C4Control.
 
 This class inherits directly from NSObject.
 
 C4Objects conform to the C4Notification protocol which means that all objects will have the ability to post and receive notifications.

 A convenience method so that initialization of subclasses can happen in this method rather than overriding (id)init, (id)initWithFrame:, etc...
