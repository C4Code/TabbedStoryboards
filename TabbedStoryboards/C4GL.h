/**The C4GL class implements a modifiable view that handles OpenGL ES rendering.
 
 C4GL is a subclass of C4Control and inherits all its gesture, animation and notification abilities.
 
 This is the class that you should use for adding any OpenGL drawing to C4's canvas.
 
 In C4, the main role of C4GL is to provide a simple interactive object which encapsulates OpenGL rendering ability. C4GL is similar to other subclasses of C4Control, but is limited in some ways:
 
 - You can add shadows to C4GL objects in the same way as other C4Control subclasses... but that's about it for changing the style of the object.
 - You cannot specify the background color of a C4GL object, instead you should do this in your rendering object by calling glClearColor() with the specific background color you wish to use
